E-commerce Website Idea:
In the past few years, E-commerce has taken the world by surprise and frankly, we shouldn’t be surprised. Not only does it provide us with thousands of options from a varying set of prices, but it also solves one major psychological issue. The issue of shopping without being judged or observed. No longer do you have to please the salesperson who pesters you into buying stuff, you can simply do it with a touch of your finger.
The E-commerce market is too general, we want to make our website cater to a particular gender, one which goes hand in hand with shopping. 
Milady's Exotica is women’s one shopping stop. An online marketplace selling all of the woman’s essentials in a single place. 
Right now, we have thought of 8 Major Categories (More can be added in the future) 
The categories include Jewelry, Dailywear, Ethnic Wear, Perfumes among others. 
Milady's Exotica is not just an online shopping store, it is an Online Shopping Brand that will aim to sell its own range of products and later move to offline outlets like Redtape did.
